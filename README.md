#Project description: I intend to create a program that receives boolean expressions as input and simplifies them (if necessary) and provides truth tables along with logic diagrams as output.

#work done so far:
          1. Looked into using graphics.h header for visual graphics 
          2. Initialized graphics.h header for use in Visual Studio code along with C++
